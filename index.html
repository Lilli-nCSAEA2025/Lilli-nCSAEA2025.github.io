        Greetings friend! Welcome to my blog page. If you have managed to stumble upon this page then it's nice to have you here! This is a general blog page that I have created to document my daily studies and work. It may start rather shaky but if you want to see some progress, then follow along! :]

        <h2> Day 1 </h2>
        <h6> 10/24/21</h6>
        <p style = "text-indent:.5cm;"> Well, here we go with day one! Today was a semi-productive day. I finished a project for my professor and managed to get in a few hours at the shop as well. Biannca was being a pain however so I was stuck on potion duty for today. The worst thing about potions is not even how difficult it is to do right but the amount of nothing that goes on! It's just measuring and mixing and waiting and remixing until it's perfect. Then you gotta do it again until the stock is all up to date. Really a pain. But alas, I'm the only one who can do it properly. Mme Flora really doesn't know how to hire compitent alchemists. All her recent apprentices have been lousier than ever. Anyway, awful coworkers aside, work hasn't been too bad. Old Mrs. Silverfang has been back again and she's always so sweet to us. I always giver her an extra treat or two for the cubs. The whole Silverfang pack really are the best. Thought Jasmine is always crabby about her hair and nail tonics. I swear, the number of times I have had to remake it for her makes me want to rip out my hair.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-indent:.5cm;"> On a different note, the academy has been lovely. I absolutly adore my new chem professor. She is such a dear and knows so much interesting stuff. Her homework is a really long though. She really likes to make us write essays on our study projects. That's not as bad as my alterations prof. He's a dreamon in disguise I swear it. I have had to turn paper to a feather so many times it's driving me crazy. I knew I should have taken APAlt. Them it might be challenging. But I degress, the rest of my classes are hard enough that I can handle one easy class. Gods know Erylian history and inter-specieal studies are hard enough. I enjoy school and don't regret a thing. That might change around finals though but you never know. Infact I have to go finish a MM (modern magiks) lab report right now. Thanks for tuning in!

        <h2> Day 2 </h2>
        <h6> 10/25/21</h6>

        Welcome back! I'm glad you came back! Today has been a real pain. I slept though my alarm because I stayed up too late on the MM report. And it's raining today. Not the fun kind either. Just wet and cold. I went down to the library during studyhall and picked up some new books on the Magiks vs. sciences debates. They've gotten increasingly heated after the Rosenthal family join in. They're and ancient magik family and have always had a deep ties to the nation. Fortuneately my feild falls in the middle so I get to do the best of both. Though I have always been stuck between both. I will never take Computer science for granted though since the internet is one of the greatest invertions ever. Sure spells and archives are lovely, but it is so much easier to be a student with access to everything. Besides, that's how you all are reading this!! My mother works in the academy archives and is always complaining about studets asking to have everything digitalized. A mounmental task when theres over 600 years of history and learning in one place. Some texts are so old that they aren't even in the logs. Always an adventure when you go to the archives. <br> <strong> On a different note, if anyone is interested in my music collection let me know! My friends and I are working on creating a full playlist of my music and everything I enojy and I want to post it for y'all. I'll leave a link when it's done.</strong> That's it for today everyone! Margret signing off!
